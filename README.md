# Health Econ II Demand Estimation
 Empirical Exercise for Health Econ II Class. To reproduce this exercise:
 (1) navigate to the ./Analysis folder and run the "preprocess_data.py" file. This code will load data files from ./Data, perform a crosswalk between zip code and hrr & "mkt", calculate market shares and HHI, and finally produce a new data file called "0416.dta".
 (2) open ./Analysis/main_analysis.do file in Stata, modify the first line to change your working directory properly, then run the entire do file.
